# Skills Workshops

Short format workshops that run over one or more days can be a great way to bring people together to share skills. For workshops to be most impactful, it is important to use good quality lessons and have them taught by prepared instructors. The Carpentries supports and mentors a global community of instructors and lessons they can teach.  


## Software Carpentry

Overview of [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshops

### Lessons

Software Carpentry aims to help people begin to think computationally about the work they do. It does this by introducing the shell for task automation, then by introducing a programming language such as R or Python, and then by bringing in version control systems such as Git to ensure that research work done can be easily retrieved, repeated, or adapted for other uses. Using these methods, learners can lay the foundation for performing open, reproducible research. 

Software Carpentry maintains lessons in the Unix Shell, Git, R, Python, SQL, Make and Mercurial. Software Carpentry lessons focus on teaching tools in a discipline-agnostic way, in order to help researchers from all disciplines develop skill with the tools. Software Carpentry lessons aren't meant to be exhaustive and comprehensive enumerations of all possible features of a particular tool. Instead the lessons seek to strike a balance of reducing cognitive load, while empowering the researcher to have a better understanding of how the tool could be applied in their workflow.


## Data Carpentry

A [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/workshops/) workshop teaches the core skills for working with data effectively and reproducibly.

When working with data, it’s often difficult to figure out what skills to learn or how to get started learning them. In Data Carpentry, we identify the fundamental skills needed in a given domain and develop and teach these skills in hands-on, two-day, interactive workshops. Workshops are currently designed for people with little to no prior computational experience and are domain-specific, so that researchers are working with data most relevant to their own work. They follow a narrative structure, working with one dataset through the whole data lifecycle from data and project organization to data analysis and visualization.

### Lessons

Data Carpentry currently have [curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) in:

- Ecology
- Genomics
- Geospatial data
- Social sciences

## Library Carpentry

[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) aims to help people in library and information roles develop software and data skills.

### Lessons

Library Carpentry has nine [lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/#portfolio) in the works, some more mature than others. New lessons are being drafted around FAIR principles and digital preservation.

| Lesson | Scope |
| :----- | :----- | 
|Data intro for librarians | An introduction to data structures, regular expressions, and computing terms | 
| Unix Shell | An introduction to command line interfaces and task automation using the Unix shell | 
| OpenRefine | An introduction to cleaning up and enhancing a dataset using OpenRefine | 
| Git Intro for Librarians | An introduction to version control using Git and GitHub for collaboration | 
| SQL for Librarians| An introduction to relational database management using the SQLite tool | 
| Webscraping | An introduction to extracting structured data from websites using a range of tools | 
| Tidy data for librarians | An introduction to good data organisation, which is the foundation of much of our day-to-day work in libraries | 
| Introduction to Python | An introduction to Python, a general purpose programming language | 
| Data Intro for Archivists | An introduction to data structures, regular expressions, and computing terms for archivists | 

## Other Skills Workshops

The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org) has a number of useful [lessons](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/) on a range of tools and skills. 

These lessons would be appplicable to anyone who wants to imrpove their digital skills - they have wider relevance beyond the fields of history and the humanities. 

# Help Sessions

Help sessions of many kinds have been created within Carpentries member institutions. What is common is that such sessions be  regularly scheduled and frequent, and provide a neutral space where people can come together to support each other with technical challenges. 

Events of this type include Hacky Hour, PhTea, Code and Pizza, SkillShares, or Office Hours. These kinds of events can be slow to get started, with it sometimes taking weeks or months to develop a steady cohort of regulars. To get started, think about assembling an 'anchoring' group that can offer a range of useful skills. These might be sysadmins, bioinformaticians, a GIS librarian, a person with data management knowledge, HPC or other technical support staff, and graduate students from a range of disciplines. If this seems completely unattainable, start out with small. Hacky Hours have been started by two people and have then seen them grow. The key is to start, and not to get discouraged if people don't flock in for advice at first. Word of mouth will help populate it as time goes by.

Mature community help sessions become as useful to the so-called experts as they are for the novice and intermediate researchers. Having them in an informal setting with the ability to order food/coffee/beer at your own expense is also popular. In other cases, a budget for pizza and/or snacks is requested to provide extra enticement.

## Hacky Hour

Hacky Hours are informal, regularly scheduled meetups where researchers can bring research IT-related issues for discussion or help.

These might include issues with Python, R, HPC, statistics, MatLab or other software.

They are generally volunteer-run, and aim to build referral networks and communities of practice around research software and skills.

# Book Clubs
# Events

There are various kinds of annual/semi-annual events you can run to give your community a focused opportunity to share and plan more intensely with each other, and to invite new members into the community. Within The Carpentries campus communities, ResBaz (Research Bazaar) is a popular multi-day event to share research software tools and how to use them. These events are as much about training and skills as they are about networking and ideas. There are many types of un-conference and satellite conference that can be exciting to bring to your organization. These include events like OpenCon-local, THATCamp and more. Planning one of these local satellite events can be a great way to bring people together on your campus. Additionally, there are several events in the Carpentries community that draw Carpentries instructors. We have an etherpad where we share among the instructor community what conferences we'll be attending. In the cookbook we'll list some marquee events that bring many Carpentries community members together.

# Research Bazaar (ResBaz)

ResBaz is a 3-day research festival to teach skills and help people build local communities. It generally encompasses workshops such
as Software and Data Carpentry workshops, along with a range of talks, games, poster and networking sessions such as the Knowledge Bazaar.

ResBaz was first run in Melbourne in 2015. The model quickly became popular, and ResBaz events were run in ten cities worldwide in 2016
and in 14 locations in 2017. [ResBaz 2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/) events have been run in nine cities this year.

# CarpentryCon

CarpentryCon is the key community building and networking event in the Carpentries' annual calendar.

The inaugural 2018 [CarpentryCon](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) was held from 30 May - 1 June at University College, Dublin.

The theme of CarpentryCon 2018 was *Building Locally, Connecting Globally*.

## Purpose and Scope of CarpentryCon

- **Community Building:** bring together members of the Carpentry community, including instructors, partners, advocates, and staff, together with people sharing similar interests from around the globe. We had a “come and learn” format that is different from most conferences.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** The event included sessions on teaching methods, curriculum development, community organization, and leadership skills.
- **Networking:** Opportunities were provided for participants to come together informally to share stories about challenges and successes.
- **Contributed talks/posters:** There was a poster session where attendees shared how they have incorporated Carpentry techniques into their own research and teaching, and/or how they have grown their local Carpentry community. This was crucial as presenting was a requirement for attendees who sought travel support from their home institution.

## The CarpentryCon Task Force

The [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/TaskForces/2018-CarpentryCon) was created within the Carpentries to help organize and coordinate CarpentryCon events.

All progress on above items is reported within the [CarpentryCon repo](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon).

# Vendor Training

If you have researchers who use a particular vendor tool, sensor or apparatus, it is often possible to bring that vendor in for local on-site training. Depending on the vendor, this can be a costly per-seat workshop, or it can be done for free. It is also possible to work to build a relationship with the vendor so that theyy are able to see how their training might lead to future sales or to a continued use of their products. In this section, we'll share some thoughts and ideas on vendor supplied trainings that can be useful to build into your local community. Vendors are working to stay in business, and your ability as a researcher to use their complex tools and systems is an important part of how you're able to be research-capable. By working together to seek high-quality and relevant training from the key vendors supporting academic research, we can work together to make these trainings impactful and useful for our local communities.
